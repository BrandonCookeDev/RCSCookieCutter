To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Cherubi KnighT. The humour is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of Star Wars and Halo fandom most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer‚Äôs head. There‚Äôs also Rick‚Äôs nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realise that they‚Äôre not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Rick & Morty truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn‚Äôt appreciate, for instance, the humour in Rick‚Äôs existential catchphrase ‚ÄúWubba Lubba Dub Dub,‚Äù which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev‚Äôs Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I‚Äôm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Dan Harmon‚Äôs genius wit unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools.. how I pity them. üòÇ
